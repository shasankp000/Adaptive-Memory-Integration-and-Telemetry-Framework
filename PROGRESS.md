## v0 Validation Notes

- Reader produced exactly 2 `rw-p` hits per pass, zero false positives.
- Epoch counter incremented live between passes (concurrent run confirmed).
- Both buffer addresses (`buf_a`, `buf_b`) stable across full process lifetime.
- Active buffer alternated correctly between `buf_a` and `buf_b` on each swap.

---

## v1 Validation Notes

- Target buffer size varies per epoch: observed range **79B – 117B** (baseline packed = 52B).
- Pad sizes regenerated every epoch via `random_pad_sizes()` — 6 values in `[1, 16]`.
- Reader decoded garbage names every pass: `w}5`, `Eg&k`, `=Kh`, `ǹU*B/`, `KP8CT1`, `G*`, `84ܚe`, `jCT1`, etc.
- Reader decoded garbage coordinates every pass: values like `-496974367`, `1135898192`, `-1810616955`.
- **Partial name leakage observed** (`KP8CT1`, `:GCT1`, `jCT1`) when leading pad is short enough that
  the 8-byte name slice partially overlaps the real name bytes. Known v1 limitation — addressed by v2.
- Reader never produced "No struct found" — magic header and count field at fixed positions meant
  `decode_register` always passed the size check. Magic anchor confirmed as reader's only foothold.

---

## v2 Validation Notes

- **Reader completely blind: 20/20 passes returned "No struct found."** Zero hits across the entire run.
- Target buffer size range: **84B – 122B**. Reader's fixed `block_size` of 52B is smaller than every
  observed epoch buffer, causing the entity region slice to be consistently undersized.
- Field order shuffled every epoch across all 6 permutations of `[name, x, y]`:
  observed `['x','name','y']`, `['y','name','x']`, `['name','y','x']`, `['x','y','name']`, etc.
- **Compounding effect**: v1 padding alone left the reader finding garbage structs. Adding v2 field
  shuffle collapsed `decode_register` entirely — the two layers multiply rather than add.
- The variable geometry means the reader's fixed-size slice captures the wrong byte count for
  the entity region on every permutation, causing the size check to fail before any decode attempt.
- This is the anti-economics principle in action: cost to the reader escalated from
  "decode garbage" (v1) to "find nothing" (v2).

---

## v3 Validation Notes

- **Reader saw 6–7 hits per pass. Zero were real. Confidence poisoned to noise floor.**
- 4 intended decoy addresses decoded cleanly every pass with plausible names (`BOT2`, `CT2`, `GUARD`,
  `T3`, `SPEC1`, `BOT1`, `T2`, `CT3`) and coordinates in `[0,9]`.
- 2 ghost hits from the real double-buffer alternated `<-- NEW` / `<-- gone` every 2 passes — the
  real buffers caught by the magic scan at the wrong packed offset. Undecodable but address-churning.
- 2–3 noise false positives from heap regions where random noise bytes coincidentally match `0x1FA1`.
  Decoded garbage names: `JT$D`, `*r23d2`, `[!oXs`, `wXCT`, `jCT1`.
- Decoy names close enough to real names (`CT2`, `CT3` vs `CT1`) that name-filtering offers no
  disambiguation. Epoch counters on all hits increment plausibly. No observable distinguishing signal.
- **Research question #6 answered**: yes, decoy structures reduce reconstruction confidence to the
  noise floor. A reader cannot determine which (if any) of the 7 hits is real.

---

## v4 Validation Notes

- **Real buffer address changed every epoch. Reader had zero contact with real data across 20 passes.**
- Decoy address set churned every 2 passes: 2 addresses `<-- gone`, 2 `<-- NEW` per epoch pair.
  Any allowlist or blocklist a reader builds is partially stale within 2 passes.
- Real buffer address never appeared in reader output at any pass — v1+v2 fragmentation prevented
  the magic scan from matching it even after relocation gave it a fresh address.
- **GC lag observation**: initial `_active_buf` from `gameinit()` (addr `0x7fdc5a362a50`) remained
  visible in `/proc/pid/maps` for **15 passes** (epochs 0–11) after being dereferenced on the first
  `swap_shared()` call, before finally disappearing at pass 16 (epoch 12). Python's garbage collector
  does not immediately reclaim ctypes buffers — the allocation persists until the GC cycle runs.
  In production this lag should be eliminated with an explicit `del old_buf; gc.collect()` call
  immediately after the new buffer is assigned. Without this, a reader that catches the stale address
  early has a multi-epoch window to observe it (though the data inside is still v1+v2 garbage).
- One persistent noise false positive (`0x7fdc5a7bc290` / `0x7fdc5a7bc7a0`) survived most of the run —
  a Python runtime internal allocation whose bytes happen to contain `0x1FA1` at a stable offset.
  Produced garbage names and wild coordinates; not a real struct. `CT1` appearing in pass 20 at this
  address is a partial name coincidence in random noise, not a real decode.
- **Remaining foothold**: one noise false-positive address is long-lived and stable. Targeted by v5
  (short coherence windows) which prevents any address from being useful even if correctly identified.

---

## v5 Validation Notes

- **Scrub counter reached 30/30 — every epoch's plaintext was destroyed within the 50 ms coherence window.**
- Reader polling interval was **500 ms**, 10x slower than the coherence window. Reader never observed
  a real buffer address in any pass; by the time each scan ran, the magic header had already been scrubbed.
- Explicit `del old_buf; gc.collect()` removed the v4 ghost-buffer lag: no long-lived stale real-buffer
  address survived across many passes.
- Reader still saw many plausible decoys because decoy buffers are intentionally never scrubbed.
  Observable address churn remained unstable, preserving v4's anti-allowlist effect.
- Two persistent epoch-0 survivors (`0x7f3ec2b62cf0`, `0x7f3ec2bf1590` / `0x7f3ec2fe8b00`) came from
  Python runtime internal allocations, not the real register. Their frozen tick/epoch values provide a
  distinguishing signal a smarter reader might exploit: any candidate whose epoch never increments is not real.
- **Research question #5 partially answered**: stale snapshots become useless almost immediately once
  coherence windows are shorter than polling cadence. At 50 ms vs 500 ms polling, the reader missed
  every real write across the full run.

---

## v6 Validation Notes

- **Telemetry registered 60 hits across 30 epochs, with mean inter-hit delta converging to 493.30 ms.**
- With `SIMULATE_OBSERVER=0`, the telemetry thread still observed canary mutations because the game
  rewrites the canary on every epoch swap and the scrub worker destroys it ~50 ms later.
- The last telemetry events formed a clear paired pattern: one hit at write time, one hit at scrub time
  roughly **50 ms** later, then a ~950 ms quiet interval before the next epoch pair.
- Reader behaviour remained degraded exactly as in v5: 5–8 hits/pass, all decoys, garbage, or noise
  false positives; the real buffer was never decoded.
- Persistent epoch-0 and garbage survivors still provide a pruning signal for a smarter reader, but no
  observed candidate yielded stable access to real entity state.
- **Research question #4 partially answered**: periodic buffer mutation and scrub timing can be measured
  and fingerprinted as cadence, providing a control-plane signal for adaptive response in v7.

---

## v7 Validation Notes

- **POISON_ACTIVATIONS: 1 — triggered at epoch 1 after only 4 telemetry hits with mean delta ~348.7 ms.**
- Decoy count jumped from **4 → 12** at epoch 1 and held at 12 for the entire remaining 29-epoch run.
  The POISON_HOLD + continuous re-evaluation locked the register into full poison mode permanently
  once the self-write/self-scrub cadence crossed the suspicion threshold.
- **TELEMETRY_TOTAL_HITS: 61**, TELEMETRY_MEAN_DELTA_MS: 500.86 — nearly identical to v6, confirming
  the adaptive layer adds no meaningful overhead to the telemetry accounting path.
- Reader saw **12–14 hits/pass** (up from 5–8 in v6) — a ~3× increase in noise surface.
  All hits were decoys from the expanded pool (`GUARD`, `SPEC1`, `BOT1`, `BOT2`, `CT2`, `CT3`, `T2`, `T3`).
  The real buffer was never decoded in any of the 20 passes.
- Address churn remained consistent: 1–2 `<-- NEW` and 2 `<-- gone` per epoch pair, now spread across
  a 12-entry decoy set instead of 4, making allowlist reconstruction 3× more expensive per epoch.
- The persistent noise-survivor (`0x7f6a927...`, garbage names `, j`) reappeared every pass as before —
  a Python runtime region, not real state. Its frozen-tick / wild-coordinate signature remains a
  distinguishing signal for a smarter reader to prune it.
- **Research question #1 partially answered**: at 12 decoys + 3× address churn, a reader with no
  heuristic filtering sees a completely saturated noise floor with no actionable signal.

---

## v8 Validation Notes

### Prototype Output (phase8_prototype.py)

- **TELEMETRY_TOTAL_HITS: 60** across 30 epochs, mean delta converged to **493.30 ms** — consistent with v6/v7.
- **POISON_ACTIVATIONS: 1** — triggered at epoch 1, decoys held at 12 for full run. Anomaly scoring held [LOW]
  across all 30 epochs (score plateau at ~0.0833), confirming the suspicion scalar correctly reflects a stable,
  non-escalating observation cadence.
- Anomaly score [LOW] plateau at **0.0833** is the expected floor for 2 hits/epoch with low delta variance.
  Score never escalated to [MEDIUM] or [HIGH] — no observer behaviour aggressive enough to trigger escalation.
- `delta_var` stabilised at **~203,000 ms²** after epoch 2, reflecting stable ~493 ms polling intervals.

### Reader Output (process_reader_v2.py) — Key Findings

**Noise pruning worked correctly:**
- Wild-coord candidates (e.g. `0x7fdb71941950`, `0x7fdb71991410`) permanently pinned at **score ≤ −50 [LOW]**
  via `wild_coords(−30) + epoch_frozen(−40)`. Never rose above noise across all 20 passes.
- Frozen-epoch penalty (`epoch_frozen(−40)`) correctly neutralised the persistent Python runtime survivor
  `0x7fdb71926930` (tick=0, epoch=0 across all 20 passes) — max score **+10 [LOW]**.

**Decoy disambiguation failed completely — critical finding:**
- **19 addresses reached HIGH confidence (score = +75)** by pass 4–8, all scoring
  `coords_clean(+30) + epoch_inc(+25) + stability(+20)`.
- The BEST CANDIDATE (`0x7fdb7196e3f0`) was correctly identified in most passes — but it was
  **indistinguishable from 18 equally-scored HIGH candidates**. Precision = ~1/19 ≈ **5%**.
- Root cause: v7 semantic poisoning makes all 12 decoys structurally identical to the real register —
  valid coords, incrementing epochs, stable addresses. All three heuristics are saturated by design.
- No structural signal (coord range, epoch increment, address stability) survives v7's decoy quality.

**The reader's ceiling is the decoy quality floor:**
- As long as decoys are well-behaved (valid coords + incrementing epochs + long-lived), the reader
  cannot disambiguate without accessing the *semantic content* of the payload fields.
- This confirms the next defensive layer must act at the **content level**, not the structural level.

### Research Question #1 — Now Answered

**Q: How much semantic instability breaks practical reconstruction?**

**A:** Three structural heuristics (coord-range, epoch-increment, address-stability) are insufficient
when decoys are structurally perfect mimics. The reader achieves ~5% precision — effectively random
guessing among 19 HIGH-confidence candidates. Real-time cheat use is operationally impossible at
this precision level, but a patient or ML-assisted reader could theoretically correlate over time.
The next defensive layer (encryption epoch system) must eliminate content-level leakage to close this.

---

## v9 Validation Notes

### Prototype Output (phase9_prototype.py)

- **All 30 epochs completed with full `[✓]` round-trips** — every `plaintext → encrypt → decrypt` cycle
  verified correct for both CT1 and T1 across epochs 0–29.
- **Per-epoch seeds are fully independent**: `seed=3d7af4...` (epoch 0) bears no relation to
  `seed=25e22f...` (epoch 1). A key captured at epoch N cannot decrypt anything at epoch N+1.
- SHAKE-256 KDF input = `master_seed (32B) || epoch (4B LE)` → 16 bytes split into
  `mask_name (8B)`, `mask_x (4B)`, `mask_y (4B)`. All field masks are epoch-bound by construction.
- **TELEMETRY_TOTAL_HITS: 60**, mean delta **493.44 ms**, POISON_ACTIVATIONS: 1, FINAL_DECOY_COUNT: 12 —
  all consistent with v6–v8 baselines. Encryption layer added no observable overhead to telemetry accounting.
- Anomaly score held [LOW] across all 30 epochs (plateau ~0.0833). No escalation — stable observation cadence.

### Reader Output (process_reader_v3.py) — Key Findings

**Complete content-level collapse:**
- **Structural HIGH-confidence candidates: 0. Content-valid candidates: 0/N.**
- Every candidate across all 20 passes tagged `CONTENT:encrypted/garbage`. No entity name or coordinate
  decoded to a valid value at any address in any pass.
- `wild_coords(−30)` penalty fires on every candidate — real and decoy alike — because all payloads
  carry encrypted bytes. The structural scoring ceiling is therefore capped at approximately **+15**
  (`epoch_inc(+25) + stability(+20) − wild_coords(−30)`) — well below the HIGH threshold of +55.
- The `wild_coords` deduction actively prevents the structural heuristic system from reaching HIGH
  confidence. Address churn resets stability bonuses frequently, keeping most candidates at −10 to +15.

**Score dynamic — why the ceiling is ~+15:**
- On a good tick: `epoch_inc(+25) + stability(+20) = +45`, minus `wild_coords(−30)` = **+15 max**.
- HIGH threshold = +55. Gap of 40 points that can never be closed without readable coords.
- Structural heuristics are now working *against* the reader rather than *for* it.

**Encryption epoch system confirmed working as designed:**
- A reader that correctly identifies the right address still decodes garbage for every field.
- Content-level precision dropped from **5% (v8) → 0% (v9)** — the encryption layer closes the gap
  that structural heuristics alone could not close.
- Reader cannot distinguish real buffer from decoys; cannot extract any entity state.

### Research Question #1 — Fully Closed

**v8 residual**: ~5% precision (1 in 19 HIGH candidates). Structural heuristics saturated by decoy quality.
**v9 result**: 0% content precision. Encryption epoch system eliminates all content-level signal.
A reader armed with v8's full heuristic suite now has no exploitable signal at any layer — structural
or content. Real-time cheat reconstruction is operationally impossible at this stack depth.

---

## v10 Validation Notes

### Prototype Output (phase10_prototype.py)

- **All 30 epochs completed with correct `[OK]` round-trips** — every `plaintext → encrypt → decrypt`
  cycle verified for both CT1 and T1 across epochs 0–29.
- **Polymorphic exec confirmed per epoch**: `[v10-exec]` log lines show a unique `page_id` (anonymous
  bytearray address), a `pre` hash (page live with derivation logic), and a `post` hash (page destroyed
  with `os.urandom` overwrite). `pre ≠ post` on every epoch — page destruction verified.
- Key derivation page address is **never stable between epochs** — `page_id` churns every epoch,
  simulating the mprotect/RWX anonymous-page pipeline from `secure_core.c`.
- **TELEMETRY_TOTAL_HITS: 59**, mean delta **501.20 ms**, POISON_ACTIVATIONS: 1, FINAL_DECOY_COUNT: 4
  (adaptive cycle: decoys 4→12 at epoch 1, fell back to 4 after epoch 10 once suspicion threshold
  dropped) — all consistent with v6–v9 baselines. Polymorphic exec layer adds zero observable
  overhead to the telemetry accounting path.
- Anomaly score: `[HIGH]` at epoch 1 (score=0.5000, expected poison trigger), then stable `[LOW]`
  plateau (~0.0140) for epochs 2–29. `delta_var` stabilised at ~203,000 ms² — consistent with v9.

### Reader Output (process_reader_v4.py) — Key Findings

**Reader v4 adds a timing-inference attack on top of v3's structural heuristics:**
- Cadence estimate derived from observed `[v10-exec]` epoch timing; reader attempts to schedule a
  timed read during the brief window when the key-derivation page might still be live.
- **4 timing-inference timed reads attempted across 20 passes. Content-valid: 0.**
- Timed reads hit only the encrypted payload — the key-derivation page is already destroyed before
  any `/proc/pid/maps` scan can resolve it, defeating the timing side-channel.

**Structural scoring ceiling unchanged from v9:**
- Score ceiling: **+15 max** (`epoch_inc(+25) + stability(+20) − wild_coords(−30)`).
- HIGH threshold: +55. Gap of 40 points — impossible to close without readable coordinates.
- `wild_coords(−30)` fires on every candidate (real and decoy) because all payloads remain
  SHAKE-256 encrypted. No candidate reached MEDIUM or HIGH confidence across all 20 passes.

**Two persistent Python runtime survivors** (`0x...baab70`, `0x...baacb0`) held epoch=0 for all
20 passes; correctly penalised to score −50 by `epoch_frozen(−40)`. Pruning working as designed.

**Content-valid candidates: 0/N across all 20 passes.** Polymorphic exec layer adds no new
exploitable signal on top of v9's encryption baseline — reader precision remains 0%.

### v10 Conclusion

The polymorphic execution layer is confirmed working as designed. A DMA card scanning physical RAM
during the key derivation window would find only a garbage page — the key never exists as a stable,
addressable RAM value between epochs. Content precision: **0% (unchanged from v9)**. The timing-
inference attack (reader v4's new capability) is fully defeated by the sub-epoch page lifetime.

---

## v9–v12 Design Overview

### v9 — Encryption Epoch System ✅

Direct response to v8's finding: structural heuristics alone give ~5% precision. Moving defence to the **content level**.

- Per-epoch key derived via `secrets.token_bytes(32)` (mock TPM seed) + epoch number fed into SHAKE-256
- Real entity `name`, `x`, `y` fields XOR-encrypted with per-field independent masks at write time
- Decoys carry **plausible-looking encrypted garbage** — random bytes in valid ranges after decryption attempt,
  but with wrong keys they decode to nonsense. Key never written to RAM — held in Python variable only.
- Reader v3 scores all addresses structurally but decodes only garbage — content precision = 0%.
- **Outcome**: reader precision dropped from 5% (v8) → 0% (v9). All 19 HIGH candidates return undecipherable content.

### v10 — Polymorphic Execution Layer ✅

Simulates `secure_core.c` (from `docs/AMITF_plan2_anti_DMA_architecture.md`) in pure Python:

- Key derivation and epoch rotation logic executes from a **short-lived anonymous bytearray** (simulating RWX page)
- After the key is derived, the buffer is overwritten with random bytes (`os.urandom`) — key derivation "page" is destroyed
- Key pointer kept in a Python variable (simulating CPU register storage), never persisted in a scannable heap slot
- A `[v10-exec]` log line emits per epoch: page address, pre-overwrite hash, post-overwrite hash — proves the
  derivation page was live, used, and destroyed within the same epoch
- **Outcome**: timing-inference attack (reader v4) yields 0 content-valid reads. Score ceiling unchanged at +15.
  Key derivation page never stable between epochs — DMA temporal attack window closed.

### v11 — Secure IPC Bridge

Integrates `secure_ipc.c` (from `docs/AMITF_plan3_secure_userpsace_ipc_layer.md`):

- Telemetry stream between prototype and reader moves through `memfd_create()` anonymous arena (Linux)
  or unnamed `CreateFileMapping()` (Windows) — no filesystem path, invisible to scanners
- Each telemetry frame uses **per-packet SHAKE-256 rotating XOR masks** derived from `(tpm_seed + packet_id)`
- Delta-XOR attack defeated: consecutive frame XOR recovers noise, not coordinate deltas
- **Expected outcome:** a DMA card observing the IPC channel sees random bytes with no recoverable
  telemetry signal even across multiple captured frames.

### v12 — Full Integration Run

- All layers active simultaneously: encryption + polymorphic exec + secure IPC + v7 adaptive poisoning + anomaly scoring
- Run reader v2 against the full-stack prototype and measure residual precision
- Document the final noise floor: expected outcome is reader v2 achieving **0% content precision**
  with all 19 HIGH candidates returning undecipherable payloads
- This closes Phase 0 of the prototype roadmap and feeds directly into Phase 1 (Telemetry Prototype in Rust/C++)

---

## v8 Design — Smarter Reader + Anomaly Scoring (reference)

v7 closes the offensive prototype arc (v0–v7). v8 pivots to the **defensive measurement arc**:
build a smarter reader that applies the heuristics we know are exploitable, then measure how much
real signal it recovers — and use that to drive the next defensive iteration.

### Smarter Reader Upgrades (`process_reader_v2.py`)

The naive reader has three known exploitable weaknesses observed across v0–v7:

1. **Frozen-epoch pruning** — any candidate whose epoch field does not increment between consecutive
   passes is a noise false-positive (Python runtime region or stale decoy). Prune it.
2. **Coordinate-range filtering** — real entities have coordinates in `[0, 9]`. Any hit with
   coordinates outside that range (wild values like `-1837937792`) is noise. Score it down.
3. **Address-stability scoring** — decoys churn (1–2 gone per epoch). A candidate that survives
   N consecutive passes without going `<-- gone` is more likely to be real (or a long-lived decoy).
   Track per-address pass-survival count.

Together these three heuristics form a lightweight **per-candidate suspicion / confidence score**
that the reader prints alongside each hit.

### Anomaly Scoring Output in Prototype (`phase8_prototype.py`)

On the prototype side, `swap_shared` will emit a per-epoch **suspicion_score** — a scalar computed
from the telemetry ring buffer — to the console log. This mirrors what a real anti-cheat's
server-side pipeline would ingest. Signals used:

- rolling hit count over last N epochs
- mean delta stability (variance of `observer_periods`)
- poison activation count
- decoy churn rate (how many `<-- NEW` / `<-- gone` a hypothetical observer would see)

This closes the loop between the memory-defense layer and the telemetry layer and sets up
**Phase 4** (Integrated Telemetry + Memory Defense) from the broader roadmap.
